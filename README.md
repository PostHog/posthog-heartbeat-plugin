This is a very simple plugin which sends one event to your project per minute. It can be used to ensure a continuous flow of events when monitoring whether ingestion is up and running. Works great in conjunction with [Posthog Ingestion Alert Plugin](https://github.com/PostHog/ingestion-alert-plugin)
